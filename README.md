# ThoSmooth Jekyll Theme
by Chris Akers

## Introduction

ThoSmooth is a simple jekyll theme with light and dark modes, and a hamburger-style pop-out navigation menu. It was created specifically for https://cakers.io.

To take a look, just clone the repo and run `jekyll serve`.

### Hamburger Menu

Hamburger menu populats automatically by scanning for pages in the root dir of your Jekyll site.
